        <p class="hideme imhidden">The second annual TEDxSanLuisObispo Conference will take place on <strong>October 28th, 2017</strong> in the Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center on Cal Poly’s campus. This year, our event will be encompassing the theme “Climbing New Peaks.” As members of the San Luis Obispo community, we are proud to live among stunning peaks which characterize our landscape.</p>
        <p class="hideme imhidden">These peaks represent both challenges and opportunities that we encounter in our everyday lives. Our passionate speakers provide attendees with the courage to take the first step, and the motivation to take on these mountainous events. Through this difficult climb, we strive to grow as both individuals and a community, ready to inspire and transform the world around us.</p>

        <p class="hideme imhidden">Last year the TEDx team put on a spectacular TEDxCalPoly event, selling out the Performing Arts Center venue in just over two weeks. Almost 1,300 individuals attended the event, and a community united behind the TEDx mission was created. Attendees were presented with engaging, thought-provoking speeches challenging their ideas and stimulating discussions on key issues in our community and the world.</p>
        <p class="hideme imhidden">The event featured 10 speakers across different disciplines, including professors, Cal Poly students and influential community members, centered around the theme, “Plot Twist”. Speakers presented their “Ideas Worth Sharing” to the audience and told stories about how they created, reacted to, or learned from plot twists in their own lives.</p>
        <p class="hideme imhidden">The event was received with high praise and provided an unforgettable experience for everyone involved. Looking to build upon last year’s success, The TEDx team hopes to bring an even more exceptional TEDxSanLuisObispo event to the city this October. By expanding the event from TEDxCalPoly to TEDxSanLuisObispo, we hope to capture a larger audience and unite Cal Poly students and San Luis Obispo community members together through intellectual conversation.</p>

            <p>Six-year old Levi was born without the majority of his left palm leaving him unable fulfill his dream of riding a bike.Traditional prosthetic devices were too expensive and at 6 years old, he would need a new hand every few years as he outgrew old ones. Caroline Skae, a member of the Quality of Life Plus lab on Cal Poly’s campus, which engineers prosthetic devices, has been an integral part of the building of multiple prosthetic hand devices costing only a few hundred dollars that allowed Levi to ride a bike for the very first time.

            <h3>Chris Mann</h3>
            <p>Chris postulates that wealth and work have become a “proxy” for friends, family, and community, and that building a culture of shared connection will lead us toward not just a more sustainable society, but a much happier one. Chris will be sharing his ideas of how we can learn from the native cultures of Argentina and implement the ideas of mindfulness, building long term social infrastructures, ritual, and play to evoke a more connected, aware and empathetic business model.</p>

            <p>The first call to action in creating a more diverse and accepting society is to recognize and acknowledge our individual biases. Julie Garcia examines studies done by Harvard called Implicit Association Testing, which is used to uncover and address biases we may be unaware of as a tool to determine what underlying prejudices we may have.

            <p>In a world where nearly any request can be accomplished via a smartphone app and deliveries are being made by drones… can any idea, no matter how outlandish, become a reality? Dan Fagella, the founder of TechEmergence, allows us to see a future in which Artificial Intelligence can be the tool for both technological applications and investigating moral and ethical dilemmas by providing the best possible solutions that we may not have otherwise known.

            <p>How do we respond when tragedy strikes? When we suddenly lose our purpose? Many would admittedly respond with despair, grief and uncertainty, but Todd Huston challenges us to respond with love. Todd conveys his message of choosing love in his eloquent account of losing his leg, his family and his purpose, and finding so much more on his climbing journey through the dangerous peaks of Mount Denali.</p>
